# Computer Vision
Our idea was to create a system which benefits lucrative advertising companies, boost up their products market value. The project involves creating a system in which the input is a video stream. The advertisement images can be inserted into any position in the video as per the user's requirement. The algorithm detects a predetermined position in the scene, and replaces it with a user defined pattern.
